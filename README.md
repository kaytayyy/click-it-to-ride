# Click It To Ride

Simple single-page app demonstrating fetch API calls

## Description

This is a general mock-up of a car sales site designed to demonstrate fetch API calls (GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE). There is an internal database (db.json) and a connection to a third-party API that renders images on demand based on vehicle values sent to the server.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [postcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss)
- [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)

### Modifying the source requires the above dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Executing program

From the package folder run:

```
json-server --watch ./assets/db.json
```

### Help

If there is an error with the json-server, check that the db.json is in the right place and that there is nothing else running on port 3000
